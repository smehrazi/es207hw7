## This is a much more sophisticated and reusable answer to this question than what I came up with, so really I don't think you should change anything about it. I made a list of Sans/santas, and then used subset to pull those ones out. Like this: 

#sans <- c("Santa", "San")
#match <- str_c(sans, collapse = "|")

#has_san <- str_subset(loc$'Site Name', match)
#has_san
